# E-news Express Project
## Problem Statement: E-news Express is an online news portal that aims to expand its business by acquiring new subscribers. Every visitor to the website takes certain actions based on their interest. The company plans to analyze these interests and wants to determine whether a new feature will be effective or not. Companies often analyze users' responses to two variants of a product to decide which of the two variants is more effective. This experimental technique is known as a/b testing that is used to determine whether a new feature attracts users based on a chosen metric.
## Objective : To Perform the statistical analysis to decide wether the new landing page is more effective to attract and bring in new subscribers for the online news portal.The answers of the questions obtained from the statistical analysis performed will help make a decision and business recommendations.

## Conclusion :
I analyzed a dataset of the response of 100 randomly selected users divided into two groups(samples)-the treatment and the control group.The treatment group is served the new landing page and the control group is served the old landing page.My conclusions from the analysis made are:

* 54.0% of users in the dataset converted to subscribers of the news portal and 46.0% of users in the dataset did not convert to suscribers of the news portal.
* There are 3 unique languages in this dataset that users use to view the landing page.The most choosen language used, is the French and Spanish language.
* In this dataset,the time spent on the page by users ranges from ~0.19(minimum ) to ~10.7(maximum) minutes.The average time spent by users on the landing page is ~ 5.38 minutes.
* Visually when we compare the time spent on the page distribution of the two samples(treatment and control group),**it seems the users spend more time on the new landing page than the old landing page and hence statistically,we have enough evidence to say that this holds.**
* 33.0% of users who viewed the new landing page(treatment group) and 21.0% of users who viewed the old landing page(control group),converted to subscribers of the news portal.Visually,it seems the proportion of users who visit the new landing page and get converted to subscribers of the news portal is more than the proportion of users who visit the old landing page and get converted to subscribers of the news portal.Hence statistically,**we have enough evidence to say that the conversion rate for the new page is greater than the conversion rate for the old page.**
* From the sample,21.0% of users who choosed English language,18.0% of users who choosed French language and 15.0% of users who choosed Spanish language to view the landing page, converted to subscribers of the news portal.Even though visually from the sample,it seems that the users who choosed English language had the highest converted status ,statistically,**there is not enough evidence to say that the converted status depends on the preferred language.**
* When we compare the sample mean time spent on the new landing page for different language users,even though visually it seems as if the mean time spent on the new landing page differs among the three different language users,**there is enough statistical evidence to say that the mean time spent on the new page is same for the different language users.**

## Business Recommendations :

* From the above analysis and conclusions,the new landing page created by the design team of the company which suggest that it might be more captivating as the users spend more time on it.The new landing page is hence more effective to gather new subscribers.If the new landing page is maintained and why not perfected ,it might gather many more subscribers.
* Eventhough statistically,they have been evidence that converted status is independent of preferred language which visually shows other wise,i think it's better for the company to carry out further investigations on users about this inorder to have a deeper insight and better viewers-news portal experience which might attract many more subscribers.
* I suggest the company should further investigate subscription method and find ways to facilitate subscription.This is because some users though they spent alot of time on the new landing page,yet they don't subscribe.May be subscription method to the news portal is quite complex or time demanding for some users which might find it quite hard to subscribe eventhough they enjoy the news portal .
